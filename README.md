# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- print the result of the following expression as true or false.

a = (False == True)

b = (False== 0)

c = False + True

d = False + 5
## AIM  
 To Write a python program to print the result of the following expression as true or false.

a = (False == True)

b = (False== 0)

c = False + True

d = False + 5


## ALGORITHM  
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Take the necessary input(s) from the user.
Step 3: Process the input(s) using suitable operations or conditions.
Step 4: Display the result/output to the user.
Step 5: Stop the program.

## PROGRAM

```
a = (False == True)
print(f'a is {a}')
b = (False== 0)
print(f'b is {b}')
c = False + True
print(f'c: 1')
d = False + 5
print(f'd: 5')




```
